|NEW-OPS-REQ Label| Description|
|------------------------:|:-----------|
|STRENGTHEN-DM |Network softwarization can only happen with a strong, committed standardization effort, complemented by active involvement in open-source projects that facilitate access to code.|
|DM-RATIONALIZE|Need to rationalize the DM space and avoid redundant efforts. Unlike service and network models, IETF-defined device models are not widely implemented.|
|AGILE|Need for a more agile process for the development and maintenance of YANG modules in the IETF. RFCs might not be suited for documenting YANG modules. |

|NEW-OPS-REQ Label| Description|
|------------------------:|:-----------|
|PROFILING| Outlines set of recommendations for core/key features, along with appropriate justifications, will help foster more implementations that meet operators’ needs. |
|GUIDANCE|The target application/applicability of a network management approach should be documented.|
|TIMELY-DM|Consider having YANG as part of the protocol specification/change where possible, or have the YANG document progress in parallel.|
|READILTY-IMPLEM|The availablability of implementation is concerning|

|NEW-OPS-REQ Label| Description|
|------------------------:|:-----------|
|DM2API|Readily available API specifications could be generalized from YANG modules for fast development, prototyping, and validation. |
|NW-API-DISCOVERY|Define a reference approach/process for service exposure discovery (APIs discovery).|

|NEW-OPS-REQ Label| Description|
|------------------------:|:-----------|
|REASSESS|Reassess the value of some IETF proposals compared to competing or emerging solutions (e.g., gNMI vs. YANG-Push)|
|BRIDGE|Create an eco-system where data and networking engineers can collaborate.|

|NEW-OPS-REQ  Label| Description|
|------------------------:|:-----------|
|EASE-INTEGRATION|Consider approaches to ease integration by-design (e.g., protocols and data models).|
|LOSSLESS-MAPPING|Consider programmatic approaches to ensure lossless mappings between service/network/device data models.|
|REUSABILITY|Consider approaches to ensure reuse/consistent data structure across various NM segments|
|SCALE|Consider approaches for YANG models to scale.|
|UNSILO|Necessity to handle the heterogeneity of data, configuration, and network management/requirements. Resolving such issue could draw on insights from parallel technical fields such as knowledge engineering practices and concepts associated with Linked Data in the Semantic Web, areas where it is common to manage problems of heterogeneity and data reconciliation across various application domains.|

|NEW-OPS-REQ  Label| Description|
|------------------------:|:-----------|
|IT-INTEGRATION|Need to ease the integration of low-level/network-oriented solution with native "IT tooling" (e.g., "https://opentelemetry.io/").|
|YANG2KG|Need for a reference specification to translate YANG-based data into the knowledge graph (KG).|
|CLIENT-TOOLS|Focus on tooling is needed, especially on the client side.|
|IETF-TOOLS|Ease exposure of libraries and host tools (e.g., `yangkit`) to ease integration.|

|NEW-OPS-REQ Label| Description|
|------------------------:|:-----------|
|NEW-NEED|Some networks have specific network management requirements such as the need for _asynchronous operations or constraints on data compactness_.|
|GLUE|The distinct approaches followed in both the compute and the network environments makes necessary to define suitable mechanisms for enabling an efficient interplay, while highly automating the overall service delivery procedure.|
